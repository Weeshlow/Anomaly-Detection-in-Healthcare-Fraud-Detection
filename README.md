# Anomaly-Detection-in-Healthcare-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains starter code for fraud detection in medical insurance claim using anomaly/outlier detection. 


## About the repository
This repository has two files implementing anomaly detection using different libraries :
  1. **main.ipynb** file, which uses sci-kit learn's [Isolation Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html "Isolation Forest") model to implememnt the solution.
  2. **main_pycaret.ipynb** file uses [pyCaret](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/ "pyCaret") library to implement both Isolation forest and k-NN in the solution.
